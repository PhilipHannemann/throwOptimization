# Throw Optimization
A project to demonstrate the single shooting algorithm for optimising power used to throw a ball.

During my master thesis at Siemens Mobility, I came across a series of algorithmic challenges, particularly focusing here on the preparation work for my closed-source master thesis, which is protected for five years.

The core preparation task involved calculating the optimal throwing strength of a ball for a given destination in real-time. The visible outcome is a remarkable simulation demonstrating the trajectory of a ball over time, precisely executed with the optimal strength. Noteworthy is the efficiency of the computation – accomplished in less than 20ms enabling real-time adjustments to the start position. In contrast the brute force approach, renders real-time performance unattainable with multiple seconds.

## Train Control
While the specific details of the master thesis remain confidential, its overarching goal was groundbreaking – aimed at reducing energy consumption in trains. The focus was on the development of a real-time algorithm to optimize driving strategies based on the timetable and track constraints, thereby contributing to the broader initiative of sustainable and efficient transportation systems.
